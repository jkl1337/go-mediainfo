go-mediainfo

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jkl1337/go-mediainfo?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jkl1337/go-mediainfo) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jkl1337/go-mediainfo.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jkl1337/go-mediainfo)

Go wrapper of the mediainfo library.

`cmd/howtouse/howtouse.go` shows a brief example of most of the functions. The MediaInfo library is a bit unconventional
in its design and somewhat poorly documented.
Unlike the official wrappers there are a few liberties with naming taken to make the library more idiomatic Go.
